The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your CPU source code.
testhw will run Ins.c and the four shell scripts, and
place all of the results in results.txt file in the directory with the
source code in it.
