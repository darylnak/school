As with previous programs, this version of the DesignChecker does not
check for correct consts.  I will ad those checks Thursday morning.
This time the DesignChecker checks for proper names in comments after 
some of the closing parentheses of functions.
Since the operations are identical to p4's, to prevent submission of p4
The design score can be as little as -20, which would eliminate both
the style and operation points if p4 is submitted unchanged.
Scores from p5 for Davis,Sean Davis,Steve , 

Note that the format for authors.csv is: e-mail<comma>family name<comma>given name
For example: ssdavis@ucdavis.edu,Davis,Sean

Addresses used: davis@cs.ucdavis.edu ssdavis@ucdavis.edu   
Style: 5 out of 5
Design: 30 out of 30 
Operation: 15 out of 15 
Warnings (subtracted from final score down to zero): 0
Total: 50 out of 50.
