As with previous programs, this version of the DesignChecker does not
check for correct consts.  I will ad those checks Thursday morning.
This time the DesignChecker checks for proper names in comments after 
some of the closing parentheses of functions.
Since the operations are identical to p4's, to prevent submission of p4,
the design score can be as little as -20.  This would eliminate both
the style and operation points if p4 is submitted unchanged.

The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your calendar source code.
testhw will run the style checker, design checker, and operations checker, and
place all of the results in a series of result* files in the directory with the
source code in it.
